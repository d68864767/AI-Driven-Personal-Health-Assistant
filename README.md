# AI Application Project

This project is an AI application that uses machine learning models to perform tasks. The specific domain, functionality, and target audience of the application are yet to be defined. The project is built using Python and the OpenAI API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy==1.18.1
- pandas==1.0.1
- scikit-learn==0.22.1
- tensorflow==2.1.0
- keras==2.3.1
- nltk==3.4.5

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `main.py`: The main script to run the AI application.
- `ai_model.py`: Contains the AIModel class, which is used to create, compile, train, and make predictions with the machine learning model.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for loading and preprocessing data, and saving and loading the trained model.
- `config.py`: Configuration file.
- `tests/`: Contains test scripts for the main script and the AIModel class.

## Usage

To use the AI application, you need to run the `main.py` script. Before running the script, make sure you have a dataset in the correct format and update the `config.py` file with the correct parameters.

## Testing

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests/` directory and run the test scripts:

```
python test_main.py
python test_ai_model.py
python test_utils.py
```
